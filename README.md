# NBodySimulation
“NBody Stimulation” course project that I was able to built while I was following a Data Structures Course offered by University of California Berkeley. My goal for this project was to write a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
